                                It's an interactive website and has a great appearance and I'm also very happy 
                                when I use this website when I want to channel aid funds for the polar bears out there.

                                At first I only saw this website from google when I was looking for info about animals 
                                in the north pole but I saw this website which contains important info about polar 
                                bears and is also channeling funds for these animals, a very informative website and 
                                interactive.

                                When watching an educational program on my TV, I saw that there was an 
                                extinction threat to the polar bear. It really touched my heart and 
                                I was looking for ways to help the bears. Then this website appeared, 
                                I was hesitant at first but when I saw this web in person, Overall, 
                                I immediately believed and participated in distributing the funds and 
                                it turned out that these funds reached the bears.

                                Interesting and informative website, I really like this whole website and it makes me know 
                                what a polar bear is and also I know that there is a distribution of funds there so 
                                I join the program, hopefully it can help the lives of the bears.

                                There should be many webs like this not only for bears but for all animals that are almost 
                                endangered so that we can continue to preserve them and can still exist on this earth 
                                so that later it can be witnessed to our grandchildren.
